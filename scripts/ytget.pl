##    Version     : 0.33
##    Valid from  : May 2013
##    URL Page    : https://calomel.org/youtube_wget.html
##    OS Support  : Linux, Mac OSX, OpenBSD, FreeBSD or any system with perl
#                `:`
## Two arguments
##    $1 Youtube URL from the browser
##    $2 prefix to the file name of the video (optional)
#

############  options  ##########################################

# Option: what file type do you want to download? The string is used to search
# in the youtube URL so you can choose mp4, webm, avi or flv.  mp4 seems to
# work on the most players like android, ipod, ipad, iphones, vlc and mplayer.
my $fileType = "mp4";

# Option: what visual resolution or quality do you want to download? List
# multiple values just in case the highest quality video is not available, the
# script will look for the next resolution. You can choose "highres" for 4k
# (4096x2304), "hd1080" for 1080p, "hd720" for 720p, "itag=18" which means
# standard definition 640x380 and "itag=17" which is mobile resolution 144p
# (176x144). The script will always prefer to download the highest resolution
# video format from the list if available. Do not download highres 4k content
# unless you have a 4k tv. That would just be silly.
my $resolution = "hd1080,hd720,itag=18";

# Option: How many times should the script retry the download if wget fails for
# any reason? Do not make this too high as a reoccurring error will just hit
# youtube over and over again. A value of 3 to 10 works well.
my $retryTimes = 5;

# Option: do you want the resolution of the video in the file name? zero(0) is
# no and one(1) is yes. This option simply puts "_hd1080.mp4" or similar at the
# end of the file name.
my $resolutionFilename = 0;

# Option: turn on DEBUG mode. Use this to reverse engineering this code if you are
# making changes or you are building your own youtube download script.
